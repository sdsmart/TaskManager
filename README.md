TaskManager -- Robust TODO list.
--------------------------------
This project is complete, however it is out-dated due to iOS updates and will likely not run.

I developed this for educational purposes when I began learning Swift.

The code is written using a verbose style so not many comments exist. The code's verbose descriptive style should self document.
